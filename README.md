# VPN-Project-Client-Server-Setup-on-Linux

This project shows how to set up a secure VPN using OpenVPN on a Linux system. It includes steps for generating SSL/TLS certificates with Easy-RSA, configuring server and client, setting up firewall rules with iptables, and using AES-256 encryption for secure data transfer. The goal is to provide a basic yet strong VPN setup while following best practices in Linux and network security.
